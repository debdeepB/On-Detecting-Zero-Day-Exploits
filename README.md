# On-Detecting-Zero-Day-Exploits

We have proposed and implemented a host-based intrusion detection system which is able to detect zero-day attacks with near perfect accuracy, detection and false positive rates by looking at system call sequences. We have improved these parameters over the existing systems by changing the core clustering algorithm and using a different distance metric. We have further introduced a sliding window module which enables the user or the administrator to pinpoint the location of the exploit, which would help them take necessary steps. Our system is very flexible, so it can be tuned in a variety of ways such that the system administrator can achieve the right balance between efficiency and reliability. Our system is also scalable, so parallelism can be easily achieved. Prototype implementation done in MATLAB.
